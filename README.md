**Cyber Security Analyst (Future Security Engineer / Network Developer Engineer / Lifelong Learner)**  

I’m a Cyber Security Analyst on the path to becoming either a **Security Engineer** or a **Network Developer Engineer**.  
Currently, I’m a student at **Western Governors University**, where I’m deepening my skills in **cloud computing, security, and networking**.  

I’m a strong advocate for **continuous improvement** — becoming *1% better every day*.  
Whether it’s through my labs, projects, or studies, I treat every step as an opportunity to sharpen my craft and grow in both technical ability and mindset.
