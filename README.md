# ☁️ EZEKIEL A. OBEISUN JR  

Pre-Sales Solutions Engineer / Sales Engineer | Cloud, Networking & Security | WGU Cloud Computing Graduate`  

I build and explain solutions that make sense to both **people** and **systems**.  
I’m pursuing **Solutions Engineer / Sales Engineer** roles where I can run discovery, design the right approach, and deliver clean demos that actually land.

This GitHub is my proof-of-work: **labs, projects, and write-ups** that show how I think, troubleshoot, and communicate.

**Long-term path:** Solutions Engineer → Solutions Architect

## Outside the Terminal
Shows, movies, coffee, and nights out with friends.  
I’m spontaneous by nature—when studying gets heavy, I reset by getting out and doing something fun.  
But when it’s time to execute, I’m locked in.

## What I’m Building Here
I don’t just “learn cloud.” I document **customer-ready thinking**:

- **Discovery** — clarify requirements, constraints, and success criteria  
- **Design** — propose an architecture with tradeoffs (cost, security, reliability)  
- **Demo/PoC** — show it working, not just talking about it  
- **Documentation** — clear steps, diagrams, and takeaways  

---

### Focus Areas  
- **Solutions Engineering** — discovery, demos, PoCs, technical communication  
- **Cloud (AWS)** — scalable, reliable architectures  
- **Security** — secure-by-default design, IAM, monitoring  
- **Networking** — fundamentals, troubleshooting, and automation foundations  

---

### Guiding Philosophy  
> “Small daily improvements compound into massive long-term growth.”
