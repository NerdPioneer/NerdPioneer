`Cyber Security Analyst | Future Security Engineer / Network Developer Engineer | Lifelong Learner`  

I’m a Cyber Security Analyst working toward becoming a Security Engineer or Network Developer Engineer.  
As a student at **Western Governors University**, I focus on **cybersecurity, cloud computing, and networking**, building my skills through labs, projects, and hands-on learning.  

Each project or lesson is a step forward in becoming a stronger engineer and a better problem-solver. <br>

I like Money, Video Games(Shooting), Partying, Anime (Solo Leveling, One Piece, Reborn!) , Coffee (Starbucks), working out, doing something fun, and leveling up.
