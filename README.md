`Cyber Security Analyst | Future Security Engineer / Network Developer Engineer | Lifelong Learner`  

I’m a **Cyber Security Analyst** working toward becoming a **Security Engineer** or **Network Developer Engineer**.  
As a student at **Western Governors University**, I focus on **cybersecurity, cloud computing, and networking**, building my skills through labs, projects, and hands-on learning.  

I believe in getting **1% better every day**. Each project or lesson is a step forward in becoming a stronger engineer and problem-solver.
